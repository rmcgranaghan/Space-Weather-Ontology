This is a forum where discussion and resources can be input. The goal is a flourishing community and corresponding resource that integrates the existing resources and ongoing efforts to improve reuse and collaboration. 

#### Guidelines for posts: 
- Discussion posts: Give background on the topic being raised and conclude with an ask or actionable item
- Resource posts: Target a 'tidbit' format: 1) background; 2) insight/resource description; 3) purpose served (be as specific as possible); 4) explicitly identify links to the space weather ontology or a helpful existing resource/effort
