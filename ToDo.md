This document holds action items that will grow the glossary and transform it into an ontology. Please attempt to prioritize new entries. 

1. Merge existing space weather glossaries
    - [The UK MET Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/space-weather/glossary)
    - [NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/content/space-weather-glossary)
    - [NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/RoR_WWW/presentations/Glossary_of_Space_Weather_terms.pdf)
    
2. Add new terms
    - 'Crawl' space weather literature and glean terms from metadata - like abstracts, titles using e.g., [SciGraph](https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/scigraph)

3. Leverage existing space physics (and Earth/geo science?) ontologies
    - [Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory Ontology](https://github.com/tetherless-world/vsto-ontology)
    - []()
    
    
Resourcs for accomplishing tasks:
