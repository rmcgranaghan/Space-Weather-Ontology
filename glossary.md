# Space Weather Glossary

---

_This living document serves as a community and consensus-driven glossary of terms for the space weather and Heliophysics domains with the hope to build the important terms, phrases, and language to create a full ontology. In cases where agreement has not yet been reached or where a plurality of views is beneficial, multiple versions can be maintained and terms in a single version may be defined multiple times by indicating which applications/subtopics utilize them. This will enable individuals and institutions to interoperate without enforcing a single artificial view._
